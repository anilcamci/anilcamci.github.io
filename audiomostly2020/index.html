        <div id="abstract">
          <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>In this paper, we discuss the design and implementation of a
            college-level course on immersive media at a performing arts
            institution. Focusing on the artistic applications of modern virtual
            reality technologies, the course aims to offer students a
            practice-based understanding of the concepts, tools and techniques
            involved in the design of audiovisual immersive systems and
            experiences. We describe the course structure and outline the
            intermixing of practical exercises with critical theory. We provide
            details of the design projects and discussion tasks assigned
            throughout the semester. We then discuss the outcome of a course
            evaluation session conducted with students. Finally, we identify the
            main challenges and opportunities for educators dealing with modern
            immersive media technologies with the hope that the findings offered
            in this paper can support the design and delivery of similar courses
            in a range of music and arts curricula.</p>
      </div>

        <div id="Course Structure">
            <h2>Course Structure</h2>
            <p>The author’s course, titled Immersive Media, offers a
            practice-based investigation of modern immersive media technologies,
            including virtual reality platforms, game engines, spatial audio
            systems and techniques, and 360º media production tools. Offered to
            a mixed cohort of undergraduate and graduate students over the
            course of 14 weeks, the course is structured around an equal number
            of instruction and workshop sessions. The class size is capped at 12
            to ensure each student’s access to hardware throughout the
            semester.</p>
        </div>

            <div id="Instruction Sessions">
                <h3>Instruction Sessions</h3>
                <p>The instruction sessions are designed to provide the students
                with a critical understanding of immersive media theories and
                practices. While some of these sessions take the form of
                traditional lectures and group discussions, others offer
                implementation exercises, where the instructor develops a system
                with input from the students, materializing ideas from the class
                discussions. The products of these exercises are shared with the
                students after each class, functioning not only as documentation
                of class sessions but also as software scaffolding for students
                to use in their own projects.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="Workshop Sessions">
                <h3>Workshop Sessions</h3>
                <p>These sessions are intended to give the students hands-on
                experience with immersive media platforms under the guidance of
                the instructor. They are designed to exemplify the theories and
                techniques presented during the instruction sessions through
                rapid prototyping projects, group design challenges and
                demonstrations. In group projects, the students start with an
                elevator pitch to receive feedback from their peers prior to
                implementation. At the end of each session, each group gives a
                demo of their design. Some of the design challenges extend over
                multiple workshop sessions.</p>
            </div>

        <div id="Assignments">
          <h2>Assignments</h2>
          <p>5 major design projects and 10 discussion tasks are assigned
          throughout the semester. Additionally, each student prepares a
          final portfolio composed of the project reports and discussion tasks
          they submitted throughout the semester.</p>
        </div>
            <div id="Mini-Game Design">
                <h3>Mini-Game Design</h3>
                <p>Students use Unity 3D to design a navigable interactive
                environment in the form of a mini game that employs a simple
                rule system. The goal of this assignment is to introduce the
                students to development workflows in game engines and relate the
                class discussions on game mechanics and rule systems to
                practice.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="Porting Mini Games to VR">
                <h3>Porting Mini Games to VR</h3>
                <p>Students port their mini games from the first assignment to
                VR. This assignment mirrors another in-class exercise where a
                mini game is ported to VR. The assignment challenges the
                students to think critically about best practices in VR in terms
                of user perspective, navigation, multimodality, storytelling and
                interaction design. Their design decisions from the first
                assignment are often in conflict with these best practices and
                require students to find creative solutions to adapt their games
                to VR.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="Immersive Sonic Environments">
                <h3>Immersive Sonic Environments</h3>
                <p>Students design two immersive sonic environments based on
                their everday experiences: one with a browser-based rapid
                prototyping tool for spatial audio called Inviso, and another
                with Unity 3D using Google Resonance Audio. In doing so, they
                learn fundamental concepts of immersive audio and think
                critically about spatial sound as an essential component of
                immersion in VR.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="Virtual Interfaces for Musical Expression">
                <h3>Virtual Interfaces for Musical Expression</h3>
                <p>Students explore interaction design for VR in groups of 3 by
                designing Virtual Interfaces for Musical Expression. The
                assignment encourages students to design complete musical
                systems while thinking critically about design challenges such
                as transferring learned behavior to an immersive context and
                exploiting the unique affordances of immersive platforms for
                interaction design.</p> </div>
            <div id="360º Media Production">
                <h3>360º Media Production</h3>
                <p>Students work in groups of 6 to create an immersive and
                interactive concert experience using a 3D 360º camera and
                Ambisonic sound. The resulting system is intended to allow the
                user to interact with a music performance similar to how a
                mixing engineer can manipulate a track using a digital audio
                workstation</p>
            </div>
            <div id="Discussion Tasks">
                <h3>Discussion Tasks</h3>
                <p>Each week, the students are also given a discussion
                assignment, where they are asked to respond to a prompt provided
                with a range of supporting materials including readings, videos,
                and links to applications or artistic projects. These are
                designed to facilitate the students’ critical and continued
                engagement with the course content.</p>
            </div>

        <div id="Evaluation">
            <h2>Evaluation</h2>
            <p>In addition to conducting traditional student course evaluations,
            the instructor has worked with the Center for Research on Learning
            and Teaching (CRLT) at the University of Michigan to administer an
            extended review session. The session was administered by a CRLT
            staff member without the involvement of the instructor. 12 students
            participated in the evaluation. They were asked to work in groups of
            3 to prepare a written report on the key strengths of the course and
            potential areas of improvement. Each group then shared their
            responses with the rest of the class followed by discussions.</p>
            <div id="Key Strengths">
                <h3>Key Strengths</h3>
            </div>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>The students found the pairing between the lectures and the
                demonstrations to be conducive to their learning. The class
                implementations done by the instructor were found to be useful;
                students particularly appreciated being able to contribute to
                these implementations by making suggestions and asking
                questions. </li>
                <li>They described that the course offered a good balance
                between theory and practice, and that the class discussions
                provided a necessary amount of history and background. The
                hackathon-style design challenges in the workshop sessions were
                found to be especially favorable. </li>
                <li>The assignment progression with standalone projects as well
                as those that build up on each other was described to be
                effective. Group projects were
                characterized as being productive by way of allowing individuals
                to bring their own expertise into larger-scale projects. </li>
            </ul>
            <div id="Areas of Improvement">
                <h3>Areas of Improvement</h3>
            </div>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>Students described that, in an ideal scenario, the workshop
                sessions would be conducted in a lab environment with individual
                VR stations allocated to each student. </li>
                <li>While half of the students preferred the open-ended nature
                of some of the assignments, the other half suggested that these
                could be broken down into smaller projects with more scaffolding
                provided.</li>
                <li>Programming proficiency has been described as one of the
                bottlenecks in developing immersive systems. Some students
                therefore requested additional programming instruction to be
                incorporated into the course. </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div id="Challenges and Opportunities">
            <h2>Challenges and Opportunities</h2>
            <p>We carried out a user study to understand how the different
            design considerations that govern these four VIMEs affected the
            users' experience in terms of control, physical effort and immersion
            among other factors.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="Hardware Requirements">
            <h3>Hardware Requirements</h3>
            <p>VR development today is inherently tied to the use of modern VR
            systems, which often require more processing power than what most
            consumer-grade personal computers can offer. As it stands, it is
            unlikely for the students of an immersive media course to possess
            their own VR equipment. It is therefore necessary for the instructor
            to secure a bare minimum of hardware units based on the class size.
            Taking the workload involved in the second project (i.e. Porting
            Mini Games to VR) as a benchmark, at least four VR systems would be
            necessary to support a class of 12 students. The instructor can also
            formulate assignments in a way that reduces dependency on VR systems
            (e.g., using 6-DOF first-person camera controllers). Given the
            growth of immersive media studies over the past decade, it is
            reasonable to expect academic institutions with necessary means to
            establish laboratories with VR systems to support instructional
            activities in this area. However, it is also necessary for the
            companies operating in the VR industry to offer software solutions,
            such as emulators and virtual debugging tools, that can facilitate
            content creation in situations when such means are not
            available.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="Software Platform Issues">
            <h3>Software Platform Issues</h3>
            <p>Much like their hardware counterparts, the software platforms
            that support modern immersive media technologies go through frequent
            updates. Some of these can be mandatory and require the user to
            update the software before they can continue with their work.
            Furthermore, these updates can render hardware devices incompatible
            with the development tools. While most VR companies provide
            libraries to integrate their devices with popular game engines, the
            support they provide for these third-party integration libraries can
            be lacking or out-of-date. It is therefore necessary for the
            instructor to identify these shortcomings in advance and provide the
            students with guidance on how to address them.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="Development Workflow">
            <h3>Development Workflow</h3>
            <p>One of the primary hurdles in developing content with modern
            immersive media platforms is the current workflow that requires
            designers to develop a system in one medium (i.e. a desktop
            computer) and test its operation in another (i.e. an immersive media
            system such as AR and VR equipment). With VR applications in
            particular, this workflow involves disjointed design and testing
            phases unlike other modern design tools, such as DAWs and photo
            editing software, that afford real-time feedback between the these
            phases. Accordingly, students have described the current VR design
            workflows as being counterintuitive and expressed a need for
            immersive integrated development environments where they could shift
            part of the creative process into VR, where they can both create and
            evaluate their work without interruptions. VR content creation
            within VR is indeed one of the growing areas in VR
            research. Furthermore, we expect advances in
            this area to make VR content creation more accessible in general by
            facilitating the use of standalone VR headsets for development
            without the need for a powerful computer system.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="Programming Expertise">
            <h3>Programming Expertise</h3>
            <p>While game engines support visual design of virtual environments
            to some extent, giving dynamic properties to these environments or
            implementing interaction mechanics often require programming.
            Developing content with APIs provided by hardware developers can
            demand even further programming expertise. It is therefore necessary
            to presuppose at least an introductory level of programming
            expertise from the students when offering an immersive media course
            with current content creation tools. Even then, it would be
            reasonable to permit the students to use online examples with a
            stipulation that they would be expected to explain why and how they
            utilize such resources with clear references to the source material.
            It has been the author’s experience that some students, especially
            those who do not come from STEM backgrounds, can underestimate their
            skills or overestimate the task at hand. In such cases, the
            interdisciplinary makeup of the student cohort and the group
            exercises prove to be particularly beneficial. The support structure
            among the students not only facilitates skill-sharing but also helps
            them gain different perspectives towards the problems they deal
            with.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="Interdisciplinary cohorts">
            <h3>Interdisciplinary cohorts</h3>
            <p>In its first two years, the course has attracted students with a
            diverse range of backgrounds including music technology, arts and
            design, architecture, interaction design and computer science. This
            interdisciplinary mix of students has greatly contributed to the
            success of the class for several reasons: the students contributed
            their domain-specific skills to group projects, supplementing the
            traditional mentor-mentee structure with peer-to-peer learning
            experiences. This also allowed resources from different schools
            across the campus to be incorporated into the group projects in the
            form of advising capacity, equipment and space. Regardless of the
            domain specificity of an immersive media course, given the inherent
            multimodality of the content in immersive experiences, and the
            multifaceted nature of developing such content, it is advisable for
            instructors to make their courses available to students from
            different disciplines as much as possible. </p>
        </div>

        <div id="conclusions">
            <h2>Conclusions</h2>
            <p>In this paper, we discussed the implementation of a college-level
            immersive media course, which aims to equip an interdisciplinary
            cohort of students with skills to develop creative projects using
            modern immersive media tools and techniques. We described the
            instructional motivations underlying different aspects of the course
            and reflected upon how these translated into diverse learning
            experience. We also offered the results of an evaluation session
            conducted with students and related these to ongoing developments in
            the field. Furthermore, we outlined strategies that could be adopted
            at instructional, institutional and industry levels to address
            challenges in bringing immersive media platforms into educational
            contexts. We hope that the findings offered here can support the
            design and implementation of similar courses that will train the
            next generation of artists and researchers working in this
            field.</p>
