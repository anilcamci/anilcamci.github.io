			<div id = "biobackground"></div> <div id = "bio"> I am an Assistant
			Professor of Performing Arts Technology at the University of Michigan. My
			work investigates new tools and theories for multimodal worldmaking using
			a variety of media ranging from electronic music to virtual reality.
			Previously, I was a postdoctoral research associate at the University of
			Illinois at Chicago's Electronic Visualization Laboratory, where I led
			research projects on human-computer interaction and immersive audio in
			virtual reality contexts. Prior to this appointment, I worked as a faculty
			member of the Istanbul Technical University, Center for Advanced Studies
			in Music, where I founded the Sonic Arts program. I completed my PhD at
			Leiden University in affiliation with the Institute of Sonology in The
			Hague, and the Industrial Design Department at Delft University of
			Technology. I hold an MSc degree in Multimedia Engineering from the Media
			Arts and Technology Department at the University of California, Santa
			Barbara. My work has been presented throughout the world in leading
			journals and conferences. I have been granted several awards, including
			the Audio Engineering Society Fellowship, and the ACM CHI Artist Grant.

		  <div id = "artworkText"><i>Temas</i> is a stochastic audiovisual performance.
		  The software underlying <i>Temas</i> integrates the artist into a generative
		  system as a module of analysis. <i>Temas</i> stochastically traverses the fine line between the organic and
		  the synthesized, forming contacts with representationality. Each of
		  the work's five sections utilizes a different layer of audiovisual
		  worldmaking that situate the audience and the performer at various
		  points inside the implied universe of the narrative. As the
		  perspective shifts, abstract forms take on representational duties,

			<div id = "artworkText"><b>Imagining Through Sound:
			An Experimental Analysis of Narrativity in Electronic Music </b>
			[<em>Organised Sound</em> 21(3)] <p> Electronic music engages with the
			listening habits we take for granted in our everyday lives, and reveals how
			intricate they can be. Inspired by such intricacies, I have conducted a
			series of listening experiments with 80 participants over the course of
			three years to explore the cognition of electronic music. In this text, I
			first present the method and the results of this experiment, including
			a categorical analysis of mental associations evoked by different works of
			electronic music. Next, I offer a discussion of narrativity in
			electronic music supported by these results and diverse perspectives on
			narrativity from a number of disciplines. I then construct a definition
			of gestures as narrative units in electronic music in relation to events in
			the environment. In doing so, I bring together various theories on
			electronic music with not only the findings of the current study but also
			existing research on auditory cognition.</div>
