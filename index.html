	  I am an Assistant Professor of <a
	  href="https://smtd.umich.edu/pat/">Performing Arts Technology</a> at the

					As spectrum, dynamics, space, and time become continuous dimensions of
					musical articulation, what we hear in electronic music ventures beyond
					what we traditionally characterize as musical sound and challenges our
					auditory perception on the one hand and our imagination on the other.
					Based on an extensive listening study, this book offers a
					comprehensive analysis of the cognitive processes involved in the
					experience of electronic music. Looking at the common and
					divergent ways in which our minds respond to electronic sound, it
					investigates how we build narratives from of our experience of
					electronic music and situate ourselves in them.

					Weaving 40 performances with a modular synthesizer from a 2-year span,
					A Now Unknown traverses the middle ground between the indeterminacy of
					the modular medium, and the undulating path that is a composer's plan.
					The turns of the same knob––days, months and years apart––are frozen
					and juxtaposed into an abundance of once present moments; a bricolage
					of nows that are impossible to tell when. A Now Unknown has been
					performed at NYCEMF 2021 and will be performed at ICMC 2022.
