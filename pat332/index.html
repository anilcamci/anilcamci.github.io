					In this video, I cover some of the hands-on activities that my students and
					I engage in PAT 332 Sound Recording & Production II. In the first segment, the students are
					exploring various Ambisonic and binaural microphones. We start by creating spatial
					audio content with students playing different instruments. We then learn how to
					work with Ambisonic signals in a digital audio workstation in a production
					context. Throughout the semester, they also gain hands-on experience with more
					traditional recording practices, like how to microphone a piano or drums. In the
					next segment, we see a 6-minute extract from one of our class sessions, where we
					apply our experience with recording drums to the design of electronic drum
					sounds using a software modular synthesizer. In a following assignment, students
					work in groups to apply these principles to a project that focuses on electronic
					music production.
