				This project employs VR and immersive audio to explore the
				underlying auditory causes of one of the top patient safety hazards in
				clinical environments, namely alarm fatigue, which is a form of sensory
				overload that causes healthcare professionals to become desensitized towards
				alarm events due to extended exposure. Recent trends in clinical alarm
				research promote a participatory approach to alarm design, where
				stakeholders, including healthcare providers, patients, and visitors,
				are involved in the design process. Accordingly, AlarmVR aims to
				bring these stakeholders into an immersive context where they can
				reflect upon current and future alarm sounds in
				clinical environments. In this video, we see the immersive documentation of an ICU's at the
				Clinical Simulation Center. This documentation guided our virtualizing of an ICU in VR.
				You can drag the view to explore the ICU panoramically.

					Here, we see an artistic application of AlarmVR, where it is used
					for creating an interactive rendition of Terry Riley's seminal work "In C."
					Titled In(tensive) C(are), this project allows the performer to use
					medical alarms as the instruments that play the sequences of Riley's piece.
					The performer can control the dynamic and timbral qualities of the alarms to
					alter the instrumentation. They can also change sequences, randomize the sound designs, and control
					the tempo and volume of the piece. The alarms are rendered in binaural audio, resulting
					in an immersive interpretation of "In C" in an interactive virtual ICU.
