				This project builds up on Inviso, my web-based application for designing sonic virtual realities, with
				extended reality versions of the app. Furthermore, it adds multi-user
				functionality to Inviso to support the design of collaborative environments across augmented
				and virtual realities. In this video, we see three users working together to design a virtual sonic
				environment: a first-time user works on their laptop using the web application. I join her with the
				AR version of the app, and a third user also uses the AR app, but joins us from their home in San Fransico,
				California. This project is supported by an XR Innovation Grant from the University
				of Michigan Academic Innovation Center.
