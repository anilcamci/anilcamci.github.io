				In the pre-COVID-19 iteration of this project, PAT BFA student Joey Fortino composed a trio
				piece for marimba, flute, and motion-capture performer. He designed a
				custom effects system involving granular synthesis, reverberation, and
				various filters, to be controlled through the 16-camera motion capture
				system in Davis, where he would live sample flute and marimba and
				process them through a dance-like performance. After we lost access to the
				motion capture system due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Joey created a “bedroom” version of
				this work, where he placed various sensors on his drum kit as a
				substitute for the motion capture system and processed the recordings he
				had made of the marimba and flute, among other instruments.
