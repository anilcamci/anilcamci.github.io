				As we adjusted to social distancing practices due to the COVID-19
				pandemic, our relationship with our surroundings changed in fundamental
				ways. While certain aspects of our daily routines moved out of focus,
				others became magnified. Our everyday environments remained familiar yet
				they were stripped of their social dimension. Crowdscapes brought these
				experiences into a shared space in the form of iterative and branching
				virtual sonic environments. Using the browser-based immersive audio tool
				Inviso, the participants reflected upon their experiences through sound
				and virtual movement. Each environment became an assemblage of solitary
				experiences accumulating into crowd-sourced soundscapes. This work was
				awarded the Best Installation Prize the 2020 New Interfaces for Musical
				Expression Conference.
