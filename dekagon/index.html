				Ten works of electronic music from a ten-year period: an ode to
				synthesis. Dekagon is a journey into sonic worldmaking with
				each piece leveraging a different synthesis tool or technique from
				custom designs to timeless classics. As spectrum, dynamics, space, and
				time become continuous dimensions of musical articulation, Dekagon moves
				the listener between the physical reality of their listening environment
				and an implied universe grounded in sound. This album is at the
				center of my book “The Cognitive Continuum of Electronic Music,”
				which was published by Bloomsbury in 2022. Dekagon was selected as one of the eight albums
				to be produced as Innova Recording's first national call.
