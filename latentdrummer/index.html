				Automated processes in musical instruments can serve to free a performer from
				the physical and mental constraints of music performance, allowing them to
				expressively control more aspects of music simultaneously. Modular synthesis has
				been a prominent platform for exploring automation through the use of sequencers
				and has therefore fostered a tradition of user interface design utilizing
				increasingly complex abstraction methods. We investigate the history of
				sequencer design from this perspective and introduce machine learning as a
				potential source for a new type of intelligent abstraction. We then offer a case
				study based on this approach and present Latent Drummer, which is a prototype
				system dedicated to integrating machine learning-based interface abstractions
				into the tradition of sequencers for modular synthesis.
